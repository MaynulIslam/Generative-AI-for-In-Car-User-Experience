# Generative-AI-for-In-Car-User-Experience
Create a Generative AI agent that customizes the in-car user experience, such as suggesting music, adjusting seat positions, or recommending routes based on driver preferences.

**Technologies:** GPT-based models, Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Goals: Build an AI system that interacts with users, understands their preferences, and makes real-time decisions to enhance comfort.

**Milestones:**
1. Implement a voice assistant using a pre-trained GPT model.
2. Use reinforcement learning to adjust suggestions based on user feedback.
3. Incorporate real-time data such as traffic patterns and weather conditions to influence route recommendations.
